```bash
# Start the application
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

**Demo Script:**
1. Navigate to "Ask Questions" tab
2. Ask: "How do I implement binary search in Python?"
3. Show how the system retrieves relevant context from documentation
4. Ask a follow-up: "What's the time complexity of binary search?"
5. Demonstrate conversation memory

**What to Highlight:**
- RAG pipeline retrieving relevant documentation
- Contextual, educational responses
- Conversation memory for follow-up questions
- Educational tone optimized for learners

#### Feature 2: Intelligent Code Review
**Demo Script:**
1. Navigate to "Code Review" tab
2. Paste this intentionally flawed code:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n<=1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2)
```
3. Show the comprehensive review with:
   - Syntax analysis
   - Performance issues (exponential time complexity)
   - Educational explanations
   - Improvement suggestions

**What to Highlight:**
- Static analysis combined with AI insights
- Educational explanations of why issues matter
- Practical improvement suggestions
- Code quality metrics

#### Feature 3: Personalized Problem Generator
**Demo Script:**
1. Navigate to "Practice Problems" tab
2. Select topic: "Arrays and Lists"
3. Set difficulty: "Beginner"
4. Generate a problem
5. Show the comprehensive problem format:
   - Clear description
   - Input/output examples
   - Hints system
   - Learning objectives

**What to Highlight:**
- Personalized content generation
- Educational problem structure
- Progressive hint system
- Adaptive difficulty

#### Feature 4: Smart Hints System
**Demo Script:**
1. Navigate to "Get Hints" tab
2. Describe a problem: "Find the maximum element in an array"
3. Add partial code attempt
4. Request different hint levels (1-3)
5. Show progressive guidance

**What to Highlight:**
- Contextual hint generation
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Encourages learning rather than giving answers

### 3. Technical Deep Dive (5 minutes)

#### Architecture Overview
"Let me show you the technical architecture that makes this possible:"

1. **RAG Pipeline:**
   - Document ingestion and chunking
   - Vector embeddings with Sentence Transformers
   - ChromaDB for efficient retrieval
   - LangChain for orchestration
   - Google Gemini Pro for language understanding

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - Static analysis for syntax checking
   - AI-powered review for educational feedback
   - Multi-language support

3. **Problem Generation:**
   - Template-based prompting
   - Difficulty adaptation
   - Educational content structure

#### Show Key Code Snippets
```python
# RAG Chain Setup
self.qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=self.llm,
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=retriever,
    chain_type_kwargs={"prompt": qa_prompt},
    return_source_documents=True
)
```

### 4. Educational Impact & Scalability (2 minutes)

**Key Points:**
- **Personalization:** Adapts to individual learning styles and pace
- **Instant Feedback:** Reduces barriers to getting help
- **Scalability:** Can handle thousands of concurrent learners
- **Content Expansion:** Easy to add new programming languages and topics
- **Analytics Ready:** Built to track learning progress and patterns

## ðŸŽ¯ Interview Questions & Answers

### Q: "How does your RAG system work?"
**A:** "I use a multi-step process: First, I chunk programming documentation and code examples, then create embeddings using Sentence Transformers. When a student asks a question, I retrieve the most relevant chunks from ChromaDB and use them as context for Google Gemini to generate educational responses. This ensures answers are grounded in actual documentation rather than just the model's training data."

### Q: "How would you scale this for thousands of users?"
**A:** "The architecture is already designed for scale. I'd implement user session management, add caching for common queries, use async processing for code reviews, and potentially distribute the vector database. The modular design makes it easy to scale individual components independently."

### Q: "What makes this educational rather than just another coding assistant?"
**A:** "Three key differences: First, the prompts are specifically designed to teach, not just solve. Second, I provide progressive hints rather than direct answers. Third, I track learning patterns and adapt difficulty. It's built to make students better programmers, not just solve their immediate problems."

### Q: "How do you handle different programming languages?"
**A:** "The system is language-agnostic by design. I can easily add new languages by updating the document loader, adding language-specific static analysis rules, and training the problem generator on new examples. The core RAG and LLM components work across languages."

## ðŸ”§ Technical Demonstration Tips

### Before the Demo:
1. Test all features work properly
2. Have interesting code examples ready
3. Prepare 2-3 different questions for the Q&A system
4. Check your internet connection and API keys

### During the Demo:
1. Speak confidently about the technical choices
2. Explain the "why" behind each feature
3. Show both successful cases and how you handle errors
4. Connect each feature back to educational impact

### If Something Goes Wrong:
1. Stay calm and explain what should happen
2. Show the code structure instead
3. Discuss how you'd debug the issue
4. Pivot to discussing the architecture
